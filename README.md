# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system for detecting spam emails using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Python**. The system processes a dataset of emails, extracts key features, and applies a **Naive Bayes classifier** to determine whether an email is spam or not.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project implements an **Email Spam Detection System** using:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Python 3 and Scikit-learn

The model is trained on a dataset of labeled emails by extracting important features (like word frequency), then predicting whether new emails are **spam** or **not spam**.
